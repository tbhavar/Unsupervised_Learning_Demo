📂 AI for CAs: Unsupervised Learning (Client Segmentation Demo)

This repository hosts a single, self-contained HTML page designed to explain the concept of Unsupervised Learning (specifically, Clustering) to Chartered Accountants and finance professionals who have no prior programming knowledge. The project uses a highly relatable analogy from the CA world: Client Segmentation based on financial data.

🎯 The Concept Explained
The visualization demonstrates how an Unsupervised Machine Learning model can find natural groupings (clusters) within client data (Annual Turnover and Employee Count) without needing any predefined categories or labels.
Unsupervised Learning	- Discovering new client segments -	Enables data-driven risk profiling and tailored service allocation.
Clustering	- Grouping clients based on similarity in financial data -	Identifies hidden patterns and outlier transactions (potential fraud).

🛠️ Features of the Webpage
Interactive Visualization: Click anywhere on the scatter plot to add a new "client" and instantly see which cluster the machine assigns it to.
CA-Relevant Metrics: Uses Annual Turnover (₹ in Crores) and Number of Employees as the key features.
Cluster Legend: Tracks the client count for each of the three auto-discovered segments: Small Business, Mid-Market, and Enterprise.
Code-Free Explanation: Explains the business implications of Unsupervised Learning and its role in training next-generation tools like Local LLMs for internal knowledge retrieval.

🚀 How to View the Demo
This project consists of one file, index.html, and is fully compatible with GitHub Pages.

💡 Application to Your CA Practice
Understanding Unsupervised Learning is crucial for adopting future AI tools:
Audit Planning: Use clustering to group similar transactions and allocate audit resources more efficiently.
Local LLMs & RAG: Unsupervised techniques form the foundation of Vector Databases, which are essential for feeding an LLM your firm's private documents (tax circulars, client notes) to ensure accurate, confidential, and relevant AI-generated advice.
